        <h2>Belur Math,Kolkata Overview</h2>
        <p>Belur Math in Kolkata is the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission. Sprawling over forty acres of
            land on the west bank of the Hooghly River, it is visited by people from all over the world, irrespective of
            their religious beliefs.</p>
        <p>The temple is known for its distinctive architecture, which fuses Hindu, Christian and Islamic motifs as a
            symbol of unity of all religions. Founded by Swami Vivekananda, the chief disciple of Ramakrishna
            Paramahansa, the temple is at the heart of the Ramakrishna Movement. The temple complex also houses a museum
            and several other affiliated educational institutions. The evening Aarti takes place 5:30 PM, at which an
            evening bell is rung to indicate that visitors are not allowed to loiter on the Math grounds and are also
            not allowed to visit any temple other than Sri Ramakrishna temple. The Aarti songs sung are hymns of praise
            to Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Sarada Devi. The Aarti here is different from those at other places of worship
            since one is expected just to sit and meditate. There is no religious offering made. Flowers and sweets are
            not offered.</p>

        <h2>Belur Math Campus</h2>
        <p>The serene campus of the complex houses temples dedicated to Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda and Sri
            Sarada Devi. The headquarters of the worldwide recognised twin organisations: Ramakrishna Math and
            Ramakrishna Mission are also located here. This prime tourist spot near Kolkata also boasts of a
            well-maintained museum, which contains precious remnants of the history of Ramakrishna Math and Mission.
            Several educational institutes, affiliated to the Ramakrishna Mission, such as a degree college and a
            polytechnic, are also located here in the vast campus adjoining the Belur Math. A life size statue of Sri
            Ramakrishna is also situated here, seated on a hundred petalled lotus over a 'damaru' shaped pedestal made
            of marble. The sacred relics of Sri Ramakrishna are preserved within the pedestal. The green lawns and the
            trees further enhance the beauty of the campus. All of these components have together made the Belur Math an
            important place of pilgrimage and the spiritual ambience of this place is well known around the globe.</p>

        <h2>History of Belur Math </h2>
        <p>Upon his arrival in Colombo in January 1897 with his small group of disciples, Swami Vivekananda had founded
            two monasteries. One of them is the Belur Math. The purpose of these monasteries was to train young men in
            their work, who would, later on, become 'sannyasis' of the Ramakrishna Mission. In fact, Swami Vivekananda
            himself spent the last few years of his life at Belur Math. He consecrated the ground in 1898 by worshipping
            the urn which contained the holy relics of Sri Ramakrishna and carried the urn on his shoulders to the place
            of worship. On this occasion, he uttered the following prophetic words: "The blazing light of universal
            harmony that will emanate from here will flood the whole world." True to these words, the Belur Math has now
            become the hub of spiritual movements and an assembly point of all true seekers of spirituality.</p>

        <h2>Architecture of Belur Math</h2>
        <p>The design of the temple was envisaged by Swami Vivekananda, and the responsibility of the architecture was
            laid in his hands. The architecture and design of the temple 'celebrate the diversity of Indian Religions'.
            When seen from different angles, the monument resembles a temple, a church and a mosque. The incorporation
            of architectural styles from different religions conveys the universal faith in which the movement believes
            in.</p>
        <p>The main entrance of the temple is heavily influenced by the Buddhist styles of the Sanchi Stupa and the
            entry of the Ajanta Caves. The windows and the balconies draw from the Rajput and Mughal styles of
            architectural designs, while the central dome is derived from European architecture. Also, the ground plan
            is in the shape of a Christian cross. Mainly built out of chunar stone, the 112.5 feet high temple has
            images of Lord Ganesha and Hanuman, who represent success and power respectively, carved above the pillars
            of the entrance doors.</p>

        <h2>Celebration and activites of Belur Math</h2>
        <p>Other than the celebrations of all traditional Hindu festivals, such as Durga Puja, Lakshmi Puja, Kali Puja
            and Saraswati Puja; the Belur Math also celebrate the birthdays of Sri Ramakrishna, Holy Mother and Swami
            Vivekananda. The birthdays of Sri Krishna, Buddha, Jesus Christ and Chaitanya are also observed solemnly.
            The Christmas Eve celebrations, which begin with the singing of carols and readings from the Bible are
            particularly impressive. The Belur Math also conducts medical services, education, rural upliftment and
            other spiritual and cultural activities here.</p>

        <h2>How to reach Belur Math</h2>
        <p>Belur Maths is located in the Northern part of Howrah and is about 4 km from Howrah Railway Station. All the
            modes of transport are accessible from outside the Howrah railway station and bus stand. You can travel by
            auto, bus or taxi. From Howrah, you can take bus number 54 to reach Belur.</p>
        <p>Local trains also go to Belur Math. However, it is more convenient to travel by bus, auto or taxi as they
            drop you off at the entrance to the Math. It takes around half an hour to reach there from the railway
            station or the bus stand.</p>
