            <h2>Tiger Hill,Darjeeling  Overview</h2>
            <p>Lying at an altitude of 2590 meters and a distance of 13 kilometres away from the Darjeeling, Tiger Hill is most famous for its splendid sights of sunrise from where you can see the peaks of Kanchenjunga illuminate before the sun is seen at lower elevations. The magnificent view of snow-capped mountains sitting amidst cotton clouds attracts tourists to Tiger Hill from all over the country. Interestingly, this is also the summit of Ghoom, which is the highest railway station in the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
            <p>The starting time from Darjeeling is 3.30 AM to reach tiger hill by 4.15 AM  The starting time becomes 4.15 AM in winters due to delayed sunrise time.  The roads get blocked by a convoy of jeeps and cars during the peak season. To get up to the sunrise spot, it requires a  short climb on foot from the parking spot. One can book a car or an Innova for INR 1200/ INR 1800 from a travel agency in the city or pay INR 200 per head.</p>

            <p>If you want to witness the first rays of sun hitting the twin peaks of Kangchenjunga, along with a panoramic view of Everest peeping through the peaks standing by its side, then Tiger Hills make for a perfect sunrise viewing point for you. Perhaps the splendid sunrise through the peaks is what makes it one of the must-visit places in Darjeeling. The summit of Ghoom is the highest point of Tiger Hill which is famous for the amazingly beautiful view of the Mount Everest and Mount Kanchenjunga. The first shot of sunlight at dawn makes the tip of the snow clad mountain in pale orange, a sight not worth missing. The gradual appearance of the morning sun disperses a gentle orange light to the shadowy hills, which turns into a blazing yellow brightness in a matter of minutes. Don't forget to commemorate the trip with some snacks from local shops nearby, where women wearing traditional clothing dish out the most delectable 'pakoras', 'samosas' and tea.</p>
