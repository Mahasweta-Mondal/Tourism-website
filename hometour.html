    <h2>History of West Bengal</h2>
    <center><img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/view-marble-palace-kolkata-india-west-bengal-164992830.jpg " alt=" bengal" width="600px" height="400px"></center>
    <p>The discovery of Stone Age tools in the state indicates that the region had been inhabited since then. In the
        olden days, it included the current states of Tripura, West Bengal, and Assam’s Barak Valley, along with
        Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>By the 7th century AD, the present-day Bengal became a part of the Magadha Kingdom (one of the four major
        kingdoms in India) under the Mauryas and Guptas. By the 13th century, the region saw the emergence of Islamic
        power and from the mid-14th to end of 15th century it was under the reign of the Ilyas Shahi Dynasty.</p>
    <p>Bengal continued to be under the Muslim rule till the British in 1757 defeated the last sovereign Nawab of
        Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah in the Battle of Plassey. Calcutta (Kolkata) became the capital of British India in 1772
        and remained so till 1911. When India gained independence in 1947, Bengal was divided into two parts. While the
        western part became the state of West Bengal, the eastern part went to Pakistan and later became Bangladesh.</p>
    <h2>Geography and Climate</h2>
    <p>West Bengal shares its international borders with Bhutan and Nepal in the north and Bangladesh in the east. It
        has Assam on the east, Odisha on the south-east, Bihar on the west, and the Bay of Bengal on the south.
        Geographically, the state includes coastal areas, forests, river delta, fertile plains, and hilly regions. Ganga
        (River Hooghly) is the major river flowing through Bengal.</p>
    <p>The state experiences a humid subtropical climate in the northern parts and tropical savanna climate in the
        southern region. Summers here are marked by extremely hot and humid days. Winters are mild and pleasant in the
        plains and extreme in the hilly regions. While the summer months of mid-March to mid-June are ideal for visiting
        the hilly regions, October to March is the best time to plan a visit to other parts of West Bengal.</p>
