            <h2>History of Tagore's  ashrama</h2>
            <P>The foundations of this place were laid down by Maharshi Debendranath Tagore way back in 1863. The primary purpose of the ashram was to spread 'Brahmo Dharma', a religious movement started in the late nineteenth century. While the movement was started by Raja Ram Mohun Roy, it was his successor and Rabindranath's father, Debendranath who strengthened it.</P>
            <P>In 1901, the ashram was converted to an open-air school by Gurudev which eventually came to be globally recognized as Vishwa Bharati University. A brainchild of Gurudev's excellent vision and dream for modern education, it followed the traditional Gurukul style teaching. Till date, it is one of the most visually enthralling campuses and provides world-class education to students.</P>
