        <h2>Rajbari,Cooch Behar Overview</h2>
        <P>Rajbari or the Cooch Behar Palace is located in the city of Cooch Behar in the East-Indian state of West
            Bengal. Rajbari is also known as Victor Jubilee Palace and is considered of great historical importance in
            the country. The palace belongs to the Mantris and is a grand structure that drips elegance from every
            corner, inside and the outside. Visitors will be awestruck right from the moment they see the fabulous
            building several feet away from the Facade. The numerous verandas add character to the structure, and the
            sheer expanse is enough to tell the world about its splendour. With the beautifully maintained gardens in
            the front and the splendid palace standing elegantly under the clear blue skies will take your breath away.
        </P>
        <P>The Rajbari was constructed under the reign of Maharaja Nripendra Narayan in 1887, and the design was
            inspired by the Buckingham Palace in London. The main entrance resembles St. Peter's Church in Rome and the
            rooms have beautiful paintings on the walls and the ceilings. Since the opulent palace has been refurbished
            many times, the original colours on the front are mostly lost. However, if you happen to take a stroll on
            the back side, you are sure to see the original colour of the monument that gives a glimpse into the
            aesthetics that the royalty enjoyed over a century ago.</P>
        <P>Today, the monument is open to tourists by the West Bengal Department of Tourism who arrange various
            activities at the monument including the Sound and Light Show that happens between 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM on
            Fridays and Saturdays.</P>

        <h2>History of Rajbari</h2>
        <P>Rajbari or the Cooch Behar Palace was built by Maharaja Nripendra Narayan in 1887. His father, Maharaja
            Narendra Narayan ruled as a Maharaja from 1841 to 1863. Narendra Narayan was adopted by his uncle, Shivenra
            Narayan after his son died. Soon after, Shivenra Narayan passed away, and the throne was left for Narendra
            Narayan, who was underage at the time and could rule Cooch Behar only after attaining age.</P>
        <p>Narendra Narayan had two sons Nripendra Narayan and Jatindra Narayan. After his death in 1863, the eldest son
            Nripendra Narayan succeeded to the throne when he was just about a year old. The administration, however,
            was handled by a commissioner appointed by the Governor. The Commissioners brought about the modernization
            of the administration which was later on continued when Maharaja Nripendra Narayan came of age and attained
            control as a ruler.</p>
        <p>He married Smt. Sunity Devi in 1878 and built the Cooch Behar Palace in 1887. They had two sons, Rajendra
            Narayan and Jitendra Narayan, who succeeded the throne after their father's death. Jitendra Narayan's son
            was the last Maharaja of Cooch Behar who managed the administration of the state and the Victor Jubilee
            Palace.</p>
